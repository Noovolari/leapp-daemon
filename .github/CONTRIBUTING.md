# Contributing

We're really glad you're reading this because we need developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, write us an email (info@noovolari.com). We want you to work on things you're excited about.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Our roadmap](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/projects/1) is the 10k foot view of where we're going and our day-to-day project management space. 
  * Bugs? [Github issues](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/issues) is where to report them.

## Testing

Please write test examples for the new code you create.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Leapp](https://github.com/noovolari/leapp/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include test examples. We can always use more test coverage and please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces
  * This is open-source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers, the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

Thanks,
The Leapp Team
